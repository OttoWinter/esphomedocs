Tcl112 Remote Climate

    :description: Controls a Tcl112 compatible Climate via IR
    :image: air-conditioner.png

The ``tcl112`` climate platform allows you to controll a compatible AC unit by sending IR signals
as your remote unit would do.

This component requires that you have setup a :doc:`/components/remote_transmitter`.

Due to the unidirectional nature of IR remote controllers, this component cannot determine the 
actual state of the device, and will assume the state of the device is the latest state requested.

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIO32
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

    climate:
      - platform: tcl112
      - name: "Living Room AC"

Configuration variables:
------------------------
- **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the climate.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **transmitter_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID of the remote transmitter.
- **supports_cool** (*Optional*, boolean): Enables setting cool mode from Home Assistant. Defaults to `True`
- **supports_heat** (*Optional*, boolean): Enables setting cool heat from Home Assistant. Defaults to `True`
- **sensor** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The sensor that is used to measure the ambient 
  temperature. This is only for report in the Home Assistant climate device.
