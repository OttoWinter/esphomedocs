The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I²C real-time clock (RTC) with an
integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.

For this integration to work you need to have set up a :ref:`I²C Bus <i2c>`
in your configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    i2c:
      sda: D1
      scl: D2

DS3231 as Time Source
---------------------

To use DS3231 chip as time source define it as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # DS3231 as time source
    time:
      - platform: ds3231


See :doc:`time` for config options for the DS3231 time source.

DS3231 as Temperature Sensor
----------------------------

The DS3231 chip has built in thermometer for cyrstal oscillator compensation.
To read temperature readings define the following sensor:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    sensor:
      - platform: ds3231
        temperature:
          name: "Living Room Temperature"
