    :description: Instructions for setting up time-based covers in ESPHome.

The ``time_based`` cover platform allows you to create covers with position control that do not
have any position feedback. The state of the cover is thus always an assumed one, the current
position is approximated with the time the cover has been moving in a direction.

    # Example configuration entry
    cover:

        open_action:
          - switch.turn_on: open_cover_switch
        open_duration: 2.1min

        close_action:
          - switch.turn_on: close_cover_switch
        close_duration: 2min

        stop_action:
          - switch.turn_off: open_cover_switch
          - switch.turn_off: close_cover_switch
