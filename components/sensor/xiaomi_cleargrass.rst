The ``xiaomi_cleargrass`` sensor platform lets you track the output of Xiaomi ClearGrass Bluetooth
Low Energy devices using the :doc:`/components/esp32_ble_tracker`. This component will track the
temperature, humidity and optionally the battery level of the ClearGrass device every time the
sensor sends out a BLE broadcast. Note that contrary to other implementations, ESPHome can track as
many ClearGrass devices at once as you want.

    # Example configuration entry
    esp32_ble_tracker:

    sensor:
      - platform: xiaomi_cleargrass
        mac_address: 7A:80:8E:19:36:BA
        temperature:
          name: "Xiaomi ClearGrass Temperature"
        humidity:
          name: "Xiaomi ClearGrass Humidity"
        battery_level:
          name: "Xiaomi ClearGrass Battery Level"

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **mac_address** (**Required**, MAC Address): The MAC address of the Xiaomi ClearGrass device.
- **temperature** (*Optional*): The information for the temperature sensor.

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the temperature sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **humidity** (*Optional*): The information for the humidity sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the humidity sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **battery_level** (*Optional*): The information for the battery level sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the humidity sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.


Setting Up Devices
------------------

To set up Xiaomi ClearGrass devices you first need to find their MAC Address so that ESPHome can
identify them. So first, create a simple configuration without any ``xiaomi_cleargrass`` entries
like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

After uploading the ESP32 will immediately try to scan for BLE devices such as the Xiaomi
ClearGrass. When it detects these sensors, it will automatically parse the BLE message print a
message like this one:

.. code::

    Xiaomi ClearGrass 7A:80:8E:19:36:BA Got temperature=23.4Â°C, humidity=65.0%

Note that it can sometimes take some time for the first BLE broadcast to be received. You can speed
up the process by pressing the grey bluetooth button on the back of the device.

Then just copy the address (``7A:80:8E:19:36:BA``) into a new ``sensor.xiaomi_cleargrass`` platform
entry like in the configuration example at the top.

.. note::

    The ESPHome Xiaomi integration listens passively to packets the xiaomi device sends by itself.
    ESPHome therefore has no impact on the battery life of the device.
