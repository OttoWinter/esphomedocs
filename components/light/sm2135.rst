Introduction
---------

The ``sm2135`` output component allows you to control RGBWW lights
in ESPHome.

One major not-a-bug-but-a-feature of these controllers is that they don't support saturation, in that you can send
either RGB or Cold White/Warm White commands. Whatever is sent last is executed. You can either set up the lamp as two lamps
or simply leave the W slider at the maximum value and adjust either the temperature or the color. Note that transitions don't
work if you're going from one to the other.

Having the sm2135 as an output component allows you to use many types of lights, but the most obvious one is RGBWW.

    # Example configuration entry
    sm2135:
        data_pin: GPIO12
        clock_pin: GPIO14
    
    output:
      - platform: sm2135
        id: output_red
