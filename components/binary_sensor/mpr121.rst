The ``mpr121`` sensor platform allows you to use your MPR121
(`datasheet <https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-mpr121-12-key-capacitive-touch-sensor-breakout-tutorial.pdf>`__,
`Adafruit`_) Capacitive Touch Sensor with esphomelib. The :ref:`IÂ²C <i2c>` is
required to be set up in your configuration for this sensor to work.

    # Example configuration entry
    mpr121:
      id: mpr121_component
      address: 0x5A
      touch_debounce: 1
      release_debounce: 1
      touch_threshold: 10
      release_threshold: 7

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: mpr121
        id: touch_key0
        channel: 0
        name: "Touch Key 0"
        touch_threshold: 12
        release_threshold: 6

Configuration variables:
------------------------

The configuration is made up of two parts: The central component, and individual Binary sensors per channel.

Base Configuration:

- **address** (*Optional*, integer): The i2c address of the sensor. Defaults to ``0x5A``.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor.
- **touch_debounce** (*Optional*, integer): The number of bounces before a touch is recognized. The value should be between 0 and 7 and is default 0.
- **release_debounce** (*Optional*, integer): The number of bounces before a release is recognized. The value should be between 0 and 7 and is default 0.
- **touch_threshold** (*Optional*, integer): The touch threshold for all channels this defines the sensitivity for touch detection and should be between 5 and 30. 
Default value 6. Typically the touch threshold is a little bigger than the release threshold.
- **release_threshold** (*Optional*, integer): The release defines the sensitivity for touch detection and should be between 5 and 30. Default value is 12.

Binary Sensor Configuration:

- **name** (**Optional**, string): The name for the binary sensor.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **channel** (*Required*, integer): The channel number at the mpr121 the touchkey is connected to.
- **touch_threshold** (*Optional*, integer): The touch threshold per channel this defines the sensitivity for touch detection and should be between 5 and 30.
The default value is the components value for touch_threshold.
- **release_threshold** (*Optional*, integer): The release defines the sensitivity for touch detection and should be between 5 and 30.
The default is the components value.
- All other options from :ref:`Binary Sensor <config-binary_sensor>`.
