TX20/TX23 Wind Speed/Direction Sensor
===========================================

The TX20/TX23 sensor allows to monitor wind speeds and wind direction changes using esphomelib
(`datagram <http://www.sdpro.eu/jm/images/allegati/TX20_Documentazione.pdf>`__,
`tx23_difference <https://www.lacrossetechnology.com/tx23-wind-sensor>`__,
`amazon <https://www.amazon.de/Technoline-TX-20/dp/B01HXZ3KLA>`__,
`lacrosse_tx23 <https://www.lacrossetechnology.com/tx23-wind-sensor>`__,
).
The only required pin is the black or brown cable (which is used to transmit data.)
The red cable should be connected to VCC (3.3V), green initiates the data transfer when connected to GND
and should therefore be directly connected to GND and the yellow cable should be always connected to ground.
The difference from the TX20 to the TX23 seems to be that the green does not matter anymore and the
wind sensor is just sending a datagram every 2 seconds - pretty much the same as when the green cable was
connected to GND in the TX20.

Example Usage
-------------

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Basic
    auto tx20 = App.make_tx20_sensor("Windspeed", "Winddirection", ::GPIOInputPin(4, INPUT));

    // Returns the wind direction in a textual form ('N', 'NNW', ..)
    std::string wind_direction_text = tx20.get_wind_cardinal_direction();

.. cpp:namespace:: nullptr

See :cpp:func:`Application::make_tx20_sensor`.
