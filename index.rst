What is esphomelib?
-------------------

Esphomelib is a framework for creating custom firmwares for your WiFi-enabled
ESP microcontrollers. Its primary focus is making the process to get your ESP
running as simple as possible, with many helper tools to ensure you will have the
best user experience.

Esphomelib is split up into two main parts: esphomelib, the C++ framework backing the entire
framework, and esphomeyaml, a tool that automatically creates firmwares for you just
from simple configuration files - so **no programming experience required**!

esphomeyaml will:

 * Read your configuration file and warn you about potential errors (like using the invalid pins.)
 * Create a custom C++ sketch file for you using esphomeyaml's powerful C++ generation engine.
 * Compile the sketch file for you using `platformio <https://platformio.org/>`__.
 * Upload the binary to your ESP via Over the Air updates.
 * If you're using `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`__, esphomelib
   will automatically add all components to the home assistant UI.
