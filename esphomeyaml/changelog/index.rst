New Components
--------------

- There's a new base component called :doc:`text sensors </esphomeyaml/components/text_sensor/index>` for using
  text-based inputs, not just numbers like the generic :doc:`sensors </esphomeyaml/components/sensor/index>` did
  (:yamlpr:`166`, :docspr:`52`)

- The new MQTT Subscribe Sensors allow you to get external data into esphomelib's ecosystem via MQTT
  (:libpr:`193`, :yamlpr:`175`, :docspr:`50`)

- Added :doc:`CSE7766 Power Sensor </esphomeyaml/components/sensor/cse7766>` to support power measurements
  on the Sonoff Pow R2 (:libpr:`277`, :yamlpr:`190`, :docspr:`59`)


- Added the :doc:`PMSX003 Particulate Matter Sensor </esphomeyaml/components/sensor/pmsx003>`
  (:libpr:`229`, :yamlpr:`192`, :docspr:`58`)

- Added support for :doc:`A4988 Stepper Motors </esphomeyaml/components/stepper/index>` (:libpr:`239`,
  :yamlpr:`206`, :docspr:`68`)

New Features
------------

- Compiling for ESP32s is now possible on RPis

- :doc:`GPIO Switches </esphomeyaml/components/switch/gpio>` now have a ``power_on_value`` option which will
  initialize the state of the switch very early in the boot process
  (:libpr:`207`, :docspr:`55`).

- The :doc:`Over-the-Air Update </esphomeyaml/components/ota>` process was quite buggy sometimes and the Arduino-library
  esphomelib used was doing some weird stuff. The OTA-process has now been completely re-written to be more stable
  (:libpr:`204`, :yamlpr:`177`).

- Add support for the Home Assistant device registry. If you're using `Home Assistant 0.81.0 <https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/10/26/release-81/>`__
  or higher you will see a list of all components for each esphomelib node in the integrations screen
  (:libpr:`233`).

- The current esphomelib version and compilation time are no printed on each boot
  (:libpr:`189`, :yamlpr:`159`):

  .. code:: bash

    [13:57:33][I][application:092]: You're running esphomelib v1.9.0 compiled on Nov  3 2018, 13:55:11

- Stack traces in the USB logs are now automatically decoded to make debugging easier
  (:yamlpr:`214`)

- Added :ref:`mqtt-on_json_message` and :ref:`mqtt-publish_json_action` to make using JSON for MQTT payloads easier
  (:libpr:`230`, :yamlpr:`193`, :docspr:`60`)

- The remote (IR) components have received support for Samsung's IR protocol
  (:yamlpr:`176`, :docspr:`48`)

- Added :ref:`component-update_action`, :ref:`logger-log_action` and :ref:`script-execute_action` for simplifying
  automations
  (:libpr:`232`, :yamlpr:`196`, :yamlpr:`198`, :docspr:`61`, :docspr:`63`)

- Added an :ref:`pn532-on_tag` to :doc:`PN532 NFC Readers </esphomeyaml/components/pn532>` so that automations
  can directly use the NFC tag ID
  (:libpr:`194`, :yamlpr:`189`, :doc:`57`)

- Added a ``hass-config`` command which generates a Home Assistant configuration for your esphomeyaml nodes.
  Useful if you're not using MQTT discovery (:yamlpr:`208`)

- All documentation pages now have comment systems powered by `disqus <https://disqus.com/>`__
  (:docspr:`47`)

- You now have to option to have a different log level for log messages sent over MQTT (:ref:`docs <mqtt-message>`,
  :yamlpr:`167`, :docspr:`51`)

- Added a color correction option to :doc:`FastLED addressable lights </esphomeyaml/components/light/fastled_clockless>`
  (:libpr:`234`, :yamlpr:`200`, :docspr:`64`)

- Added a ``clean`` command to esphomeyaml to fix some occasional build errors
  (:yamlpr:`181`)

- Added a ``send_first_at`` option to sliding window moving average sensor filters
  (:libpr:`240`, :yamlpr:`207`, :docspr:`69`)


Breaking Changes
----------------

- As part of the rewrite of Over-The-Air updates, the old OTA protocol is incompatible with the new one -
  But fear not, esphomeyaml still supports the legacy OTA update process. On your first OTA upload with 1.9.0, you will
  see esphomeyaml try with the new OTA method and fail. After that, esphomeyaml will fall back to the old OTA
  process and upload correctly (:libpr:`204`).

- esphomelib's naming convention has been made more consistent. If you're not using any :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`,
  everything will still work. However, if you're using the C++ API, there are a couple of breaking changes:

  For sensors and binary sensors, ``id(my_sensor).value`` has been deprecated and ``id(my_sensor).state`` should be used
  instead. Additionally, the syntax for toggling lights and switches through C++ has been changed. Please see
  the :doc:`62` changeset for more information
  (:libpr:`231`, :docspr:`62`, :yamlpr:`197`)

- In 1.8.2, you might have noticed that the WiFi performance has been greatly improved. This was due to the new default of
  the :ref:`power save mode <wifi-power_save_mode>` option: ``NONE``. However, that default made some other ESPs not
  connect to WiFi at all ðŸ˜¥. So now the default is back to ``LIGHT``. If you had a good WiFi perfomance in 1.8.2, do:

  .. code:: yaml

      wifi:
        # ...
        power_save_mode: NONE
