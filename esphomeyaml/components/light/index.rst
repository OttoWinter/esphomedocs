Light Component
===============

The ``light`` domain in esphomeyaml lets you create lights that will
automatically be shown in Home Assistantâ€™s frontend and have many
features such as RGB colors, transitions, flashing and effects.

.. _light-toggle_action:

Light Effects
-------------

esphomelib also offers a bunch of light effects you can use for your lights. The defaults for the
effect parameters are made to work well on their own but of course esphomelib gives you the option to manually change
these parameters.

With esphomelib's light effects system you're basically creating a bunch of entries for the effects dropdown in
Home Assistant. If you wish to have several variants of the same effect you can of course also create multiple
entries with each having a unique name like so:

.. code:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...
        # ...
        effects:
          - random:
              name: "My Slow Random Effect"
              transition_length: 30s
              update_interval: 30s
          - random:
              name: "My Fast Random Effect"
              transition_length: 4s
              update_interval: 5s

Random Effect
*************

This effect makes a transition (of length ``transition_length``) to a randomly-chosen color every ``update_interval``.

.. code:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...
        # ...
        effects:
          - random:
          - random:
              name: Random Effect With Custom Values
              transition_length: 5s
              update_interval: 7s

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*, string): The name of the effect. Defaults to ``Random``.

This effect allows you to write completely custom light effects yourself using :ref:`lambdas <config-lambda>`.

.. code:: yaml

    light:
      - platform: ...
        # ...
        effects:
          - lambda:
              name: My Custom Effect
              update_interval: 1s
              lambda: |-
                static int state = 0;
                if (state == 0) {
                  id(my_light).start_transition(light::LightColorValues::from_rgb(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)));
                } else if (state == 1) {
                  id(my_light).start_transition(light::LightColorValues::from_rgb(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)));
                } else if (state == 2) {
                  id(my_light).start_transition(light::LightColorValues::from_rgb(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)));
                } else {
                  id(my_light).start_transition(light::LightColorValues::from_rgb(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)));
                }
                state += 1;

Configuration variables:

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the custom effect.

  especially useful.
