Remote Receiver Binary Sensor
=============================

    :description: Instructions for setting up remote receiver binary sensors for infrared and RF codes.

The ``remote_receiver`` binary sensor lets you track when a button on a remote control is pressed.

Each time the pre-defined signal is received, the binary sensor will briefly go ON and
then immediately OFF.

.. code:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIO32
      dump: all

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: remote_receiver
        name: "Panasonic Remote Input"
        panasonic:
          address: 0x4004
          command: 0x100BCBD

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the binary sensor.
- The remote code, see :ref:`remote_transmitter-codes`. Only one
  of them can be specified per binary sensor.
- **remote_receiver_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the :doc:`/esphomeyaml/components/remote_receiver`.
  Defaults to the first hub in your configuration.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Binary Sensor <config-binary_sensor>`
  and :ref:`MQTT Component <config-mqtt-component>`.

.. note::

    See :ref:`finding_remote_codes` for a guide for setting this up.

.. note::

    For the Sonoff RF Bridge you can use `this hack <https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/Hardware-Itead-Sonoff-RF-Bridge---Direct-Hack>`__
    created by the Github user wildwiz. Then use this configuration for the remote receiver/transmitter hubs:

    .. code:: yaml

        remote_receiver:
          pin: 4
          dump: all

        remote_transmitter:
          pin: 5
          carrier_duty_percent: 100%

    Supporting the RF Bridge chip directly is currently only a long-term goal for esphomelib.
